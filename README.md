**Abstract**: *With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.*

**TL:DR: FLOAT is a flow matching based audio-driven talking portrait video generation method, which can enhance the speech-driven emotional motion.**

Our method runs faster than current diffusion-based methods with fewer sampling steps and lower memory cost. For more details, please refer to the paper.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
```.bash
# 1. Create Conda Environment
conda create -n FLOAT python=3.8.5
conda activate FLOAT

# 2. Install torch and requirements
sh environments.sh

# or manual installation
pip install torch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Test on Linux, A100 GPU, and V100 GPU.

### Preparing checkpoints

1. Download checkpints automatically

    ```.bash
    sh download_checkpoints.sh
    ```

    or download checkpoints manually from this [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rvWuM12cyvNvBQNCLmG4Fr2L1rpjQBF0/view?usp=sharing).

2. The checkpoints should be organized as follows:
    ```.bash
    ./checkpints
    |-- checkpoints_here
    |-- float.pth                                       # main model
    |-- wav2vec2-base-960h/                             # audio encoder
    |   |-- .gitattributes
    |   |-- config.json
    |   |-- feature_extractor_config.json
    |   |-- model.safetensors
    |   |-- preprocessor_config.json
    |   |-- pytorch_model.bin
    |   |-- README.md
    |   |-- special_tokens_map.json
    |   |-- tf_model.h5
    |   |-- tokenizer_config.json
    |   '-- vocab.json
    '-- wav2vec-english-speech-emotion-recognition/     # emotion encoder
        |-- .gitattributes
        |-- config.json
        |-- preprocessor_config.json
        |-- pytorch_model.bin
        |-- README.md
        '-- training_args.bin
    ```

### Generating Talking Portait Video from Single Image and Audio
1. Pre-process;‚ùó **Important** ‚ùó for better quality. Please read this.
- FLOAT is trained on the frontal head pose distributions. Non-frontal image may lead to suboptimal results.
- The performance of taking portrait methods often depends on their training preprocess strategies, e.g., the field-of-view. The inference code includes an automatic face-cropping function, which may involve black **padding** regions. You can manually disable the cropping process in `generate.py`, however it may lead to suboptimal performance.
- If your audio contains heavy background music, please use [ClearVoice](https://github.com/modelscope/ClearerVoice-Studio) to extract the vocals for better performance.
- [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TK0VpYdyLBCTXvMUMtL528zbxJsmCHi3?usp=sharing) for quick testing.


1. Generating video 1 (Emotion from Audio)
   
    You can generate a video with an emotion from audio without specifying `--emo`. You can adjust the intensity of the emotion using `--e_cfg_scale` (default 1). For more emotion intensive video, try large value from 5 to 10 for `--e_cfg_scale`. 
    ```.bash
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python generate.py
        --ref_path path/to/reference/image \
        --aud_path path/to/audio \
        --seed 15 \
        --a_cfg_scale 2 \
        --e_cfg_scale 1 \
        --ckpt_path ./checkpoints/float.pth
        --no_crop                    # [optional] skip cropping
    ```

2. Generate video 2 (Redirecting Emotion)
    You can generate a video of other emotion by specifying `--emo`. It supports seven basic emotions: ['angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprise']. You can adjust the intensity of the emotion using `--e_cfg_scale` (default 1). For more emotion intensive video, try large value from 5 to 10 for `--e_cfg_scale`.
    ```.bash
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python generate.py\
        --ref_path path/to/reference/image \ 
        --aud_path path/to/audio \
        --emo 'happy' \             # Seven emotions ['angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprise'] 
        --seed  15 \ 
        --a_cfg_scale 2 \
        --e_cfg_scale 1 \
        --ckpt_path ./checkpoints/float.pth \
        --no_crop                   # [optional] skip cropping
    ```
